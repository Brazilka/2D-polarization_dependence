# 2D-polarization_dependence
This repository contains the Python code used to generate a dataset for analyzing the 2D dependence of θ (theta) on ϕ (phi) for tensor B2. The code calculates dot products, cross products, and scattering intensities for combinations of θ and ϕ angles.

### Software Requirements
- **Python 3.9 or higher**
- **Required Libraries**:
  - NumPy (v1.22.0 or higher)
  - Matplotlib (v3.5.0 or higher)
  - Pandas (v1.4.0 or higher)

The output includes:
- Dot product values for all θ and ϕ combinations.
- Cross product magnitudes for all θ and ϕ combinations.
- Scattering intensity values.
- Lists of orthogonal and parallel vectors, including their scattering intensities.
- 2D plots for outpust mentioned above.
